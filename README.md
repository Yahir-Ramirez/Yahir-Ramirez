# Welcome to My Project! 👋

Hi there! My name is **Esteban Ramirez**, but you can call me **Yery**. 😄

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer currently working on my **degree project**. Here's a little about what I'm up to:

- **Current Project**: I'm developing a **web application** that allows a college to manage access control for students who arrive late. The system captures student identification and fingerprint data, then redirects this information to the college's **LMS platform**, where it is registered as an observation for each student. The goal of this project is to integrate **hardware** (fingerprint detector) and **software** (web application) using technologies that are new to me.
  
- **Technologies I'm Using**: For this project, I'm working with **Kotlin/Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**. Although I have a couple of years of experience with **Java/Spring Boot**, I decided to use Kotlin to challenge myself and learn something new.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

- **Kotlin**: I'm diving into Kotlin to expand my skills and explore its modern features.
- **Hardware-Software Integration**: This project is my first attempt at integrating hardware (fingerprint detector) with a web application, which is both exciting and challenging.
